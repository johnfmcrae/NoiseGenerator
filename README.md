# NoiseGenerator
The noise generator can synthesize either white or pink noise, either in mono or stereo. A standalone Windows version as well as a VST plugin version have been being developed.

This program has been developped using the JUCE framework https://juce.com/

An executable file for the Windows version can be found in the Standalone folder for those who want to run the app but who don't have the means to compile it themselves. Likewise, a VST3 file can be found in the Plugin folder.
